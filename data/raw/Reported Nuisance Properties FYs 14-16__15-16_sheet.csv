United has some difficulty identifying the property using the correct address (3671 or 3685 S. Vermont Ave.) so it may be easiest for them to search for the record using CRA/LA's Customer ID: USS-179096, and the most recent work order in 0-597310.  If possible, please try to contact them early next week - otherwise CRA/LA plans to have them remove the fence, at which point we'd need to have it re-installed, which would be a waste.  3/9/15 - called fencing company and transferred billing to GSD-RES; monthly invoice approximately $141.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,361,S.
